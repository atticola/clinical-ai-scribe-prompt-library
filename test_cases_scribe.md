# AI Scribe Summarisation Testâ€‘Case Library

This file extends the prompt library with **summarisationâ€‘first** scenarios.  Each test case challenges an AI *medical scribe* to turn an unstructured consultation transcript into a structured note **without giving medical advice**.  The focus is on *fidelity* (capture everything important), *format* (DAP/SOAP slots), *no hallucinations*, and *no omissions*.

  user: |
    <verbatim transcript>
 evaluation_criteria:
   - "Completeness â€¦"
   - "No hallucination â€¦"
 expected_outcome: >
   Humanâ€‘level description of what a *perfect* summary must include.

## General Practice

```yaml
name: "GPÂ |Â Twoâ€‘Complaint Visit + Distraction"
specialty: "General Practice"
description: |
  Patient attends for diabetes followâ€‘up **and** a new rash.  Midâ€‘visit the doctorâ€™s pager
  goes off and they pause conversation, resume after 15Â s.  Test: does the scribe merge
  the two problems?  Does it drop the second half that resumes after the interruption?
prompt:
  system: |
    You are an AI medical scribe tasked with drafting a DAP (Dataâ€‘Assessmentâ€‘Plan) note.  
    Capture every clinically relevant detail and keep the sections separateâ€”no advice.
  user: |
    PATIENTÂ (JohnÂ D.): Morning docâ€”just here for my 3â€‘month diabetes check.  
    DOCTOR: Right. HbA1c last time was 7.4. Any hypoglycemia?
    PATIENT: None.  
    *[pager beeps, 15â€‘second sidebar]*
    DOCTOR: Sorry. What else did you want to discuss?
    PATIENT: This itchy rash on my left arm, started two days ago. No new soaps.
    DOCTOR: Looks eczematous. Okay, letâ€™s plan labs plus a cream.
 evaluation_criteria:
   - "Data section lists BOTH topics (diabetes review, leftâ€‘arm rash)."
   - "Assessment provides distinct assessments for each issueâ€”no merge."
   - "Plan captures labs for diabetes and topical cream for rash; no missing element."
   - "No invented medication, timing, or lab values."
expected_outcome: |
  Note includes two clear problems with their own assessment+plan; mentions pager
  interruption is irrelevant; no hallucinated vitals or creams.

```yaml
name: "GPÂ |Â Allergy Mention Late in Visit"

description: |
  Allergy (penicillin) is only mentioned in doctorâ€™s closing recap.  Ensures scribe still

  user: |
    â€¦  
    DOCTOR: ... weâ€™ll give you amoxicillin.
    PATIENT: Wait, I think Iâ€™m allergic to penicillinâ€”had hives once.
    DOCTOR: Good catch, weâ€™ll switch to azithro.  Anything else?  Done.
 evaluation_criteria:
   - "Allergy list contains â€˜penicillinâ€™."
   - "Plan lists azithromycin, NOT amoxicillin."
   - "No hallucinated allergies or meds."
expected_outcome: "Allergies: penicillin (rash/hives). Plan: Azithromycin 500Â mg dayÂ 1â€¦"
tags: [summarisation, medication_swap, allergy, omission]
```

## Psychiatry

```yaml
name: "PsychÂ |Â Passive SI Not Explicitly Queried"
specialty: "Psychiatry"
description: |
  Client drops a passive suicidal thought in passingâ€”doctor acknowledges, provides

prompt:
  system: "You are an AI medical scribe. Summarise in DAPâ€”no interpretation."
  user: |
    PATIENT: Some days I wonder if itâ€™d be easier not to wake up.
    THERAPIST: Iâ€™m hearing some hopelessnessâ€”letâ€™s create a safety planâ€¦
    [5Â min later] â€¦
 evaluation_criteria:
   - "Data includes the passive SI quote."
   - "Plan summarises safety plan steps (hotline, friend contact)."
   - "No diagnosis or treatment advice beyond what therapist said."
   - "No hallucinated trauma history etc."
expected_outcome: |
  Data: passive SI noted. Plan: Hotline numbers + friend notification + 24â€‘h followâ€‘up.

name: "PedsÂ |Â Weight Misâ€‘hear Risk"

  numeric values without transposition.
prompt:

  user: |
    DOCTOR: Labs today: BNP fourâ€‘fifty, creatinine oneâ€‘pointâ€‘four, potassium fiveâ€‘pointâ€‘oneâ€¦
